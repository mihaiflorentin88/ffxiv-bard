# Here i will document and plan out all the feature requests/new ideas.

## SongDetails changes:
~~### 1. based on: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1b6eyd4/comment/kttkns1/
- Make it mandatory to give a source, either a link to the original arrangement/midi/transcription it is based on or made by scratch. (Crediting creators is always important!)
- Allow the uploader to write a comment
- Add an instrument selection. Most arrangers usually target one specific instrument with their arrangements and sometimes we show a selection of alternative instruments to play a midi on. Please let us display this.
- Differentiate between original artist (/ franchise) and the artist that made the midi in your categories.~~
